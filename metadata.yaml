description: "The Night Land is a classic horror novel by William Hope Hodgson, first\
  \ published in 1912. As a work of fantasy it belongs to the Dying Earth subgenre.\
  \ Hodgson also published a much shorter version of the novel, entitled The Dream\
  \ of X (1912).\nThe importance of The Night Land was recognised by its later revival\
  \ in paperback by Ballantine Books, which republished the work in two parts as the\
  \ 49th and 50th volumes of its celebrated Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in July\
  \ 1972.\nH. P. Lovecraft's essay \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\" describes\
  \ the novel as \"one of the most potent pieces of macabre imagination ever written\"\
  . Clark Ashton Smith wrote of it that \"In all literature, there are few works so\
  \ sheerly remarkable, so purely creative, as The Night Land. Whatever faults this\
  \ book may possess, however inordinate its length may seem, it impresses the reader\
  \ as being the ultimate saga of a perishing cosmos, the last epic of a world beleaguered\
  \ by eternal night and by the unvisageable spawn of darkness. Only a great poet\
  \ could have conceived and written this story; and it is perhaps not illegitimate\
  \ to wonder how much of actual prophecy may have been mingled with the poesy.\"\n\
  When the book was written, the nature of the energy source that powers stars was\
  \ not known: Lord Kelvin had published calculations based on the hypothesis that\
  \ the energy came from the gravitational collapse of the gas cloud that had formed\
  \ the sun and found that this mechanism gave the Sun a lifetime of only a few tens\
  \ of million of years. Starting from this premise, Hodgson wrote a novel describing\
  \ a time, millions of years in the future, when the Sun has gone dark.\n From Wikipedia\
